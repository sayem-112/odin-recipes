    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an easy way to make Korean short ribs.<br> 
        You can also substitute chicken breast or sliced rib-eye for the short ribs. 
        <br>If you use chicken or rib-eye, you must add thinly sliced green onion tops.<br> 
        This can also be broiled in the oven for the same amount of time
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>½ large onion, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced garlic</li>
        <li>¼ cup dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon black pepper</li>
        <li>3 pounds Korean-style short ribs (beef chuck flanken, cut 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick across bones)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour soy sauce, water, vinegar, and sesame oil into a large, non-metallic bowl.<br> 
            Whisk in onion, garlic, brown sugar, white sugar, and pepper, whisking until sugars dissolve.<br> 
            Submerge ribs in the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate 7 to 12 hours; the longer, the better.\
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove ribs from marinade and shake off excess; discard marinade.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook on the preheated grill until the meat is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes per side.
        </li>
    </ol>
