    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>hardwood pellets as needed</li>
        <li>4 pounds beef short ribs</li>
        <li>Â½ cup Montreal-style steak seasoning</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mild chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>8 fluid ounces apple juice</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour wood chips into the hopper of a pellet grill according to manufacturer's instructions. <br>
            Set temperature to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>Trim ribs with a sharp knife to remove as much fat and silver skin from the top of the ribs as possible. <br>
            Leave the membrane on the bottom of each rack as this will help hold them together as they cook.
        </li>
        <li>Place steak seasoning in a coffee grinder or food chopper. Grind to a medium coarseness to reduce the size of the salt crystals. <br>
            Transfer to a shaker bottle. Add chili powder and garlic powder and shake until evenly combined.
        </li>
        <li>Rub 1/2 of the Worcestershire sauce on the bottom of the ribs as a binder, <br>
            then sprinkle on a medium to heavy coat of the rub mixture. Flip ribs and repeat on the meaty side. <br>
            Spritz a light coat of apple juice over top to help it "sweat."
        </li>
        <li>Immediately place ribs on the preheated pellet grill with the thicker side of the ribs towards the main heat source (toward the back, opposite the lid).</li>
        <li>Smoke ribs, spritzing them with a light coat of apple juice every 30 minutes to keep moist, <br>
            until the internal meat temperature reaches 198 to 203 degrees F (92 to 95 degrees C), 4 to 6 hours. <br>
            If it is taking longer don't be afraid to raise the heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) <br>
            but just watch the internal temperature a little closer, as the window of being done is smaller due to the higher cooking temperature. <br>
            The temperature probe should slide into the meat like a brisket or like butter when they are ready.
        </li>
        <li>Remove ribs from the grill and place on a large cutting board. <br>
            Slice into individual ribs to serve, or remove the meat and place on a tray to serve.</li>
    
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove ribs from the grill and place on a large cutting board. Slice into individual ribs to serve, or remove the meat and place on a tray to serve.</li>
        <li>you can use a smoker instead of a pellet grill. Smoking time will depend on the weight of the rack.</li>
